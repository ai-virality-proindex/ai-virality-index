## The Problem: Everyone Guesses, Nobody Knows

Ask a trader which AI model is trending right now and you'll get opinions. Check Twitter and you'll get hype. Read the news and you'll get yesterday's story.

But none of these sources give you a single, reliable number that captures the full picture. Until now.

## What Is AVI?

The **AI Virality Index (AVI)** is a composite index from 0 to 100 that measures how much attention each major AI model is receiving — right now. Think of it as the [Fear & Greed Index](https://edition.cnn.com/markets/fear-and-greed), but for AI models.

We track **7 models**: ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity, and Copilot.

Each model gets a score based on **6 data components**:

| Code | Component | Source |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **T** | Search Interest | Google Trends |
| **S** | Social Buzz | YouTube + Hacker News |
| **G** | GitHub Activity | Stars, forks, issues |
| **N** | News Coverage | GDELT global news |
| **D** | Dev Adoption | npm + PyPI downloads |
| **M** | Mindshare | Wikipedia pageviews |

Raw signals are normalized using rolling quantiles, Winsorized to remove outliers, and smoothed with an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA). The result is a clean 0-100 score that's updated daily.

## Two Modes for Two Audiences

AVI isn't one-size-fits-all. We offer two weighted formulas:

### Trading Mode
Designed for prediction market and crypto traders. Weights social signals and developer adoption higher because they're leading indicators of market moves.

```
0.18×T + 0.28×S + 0.15×G + 0.12×N + 0.15×D + 0.12×M
```

### Content Mode
Built for YouTubers, bloggers, and marketers who need to know which AI topics will drive engagement. Weights search trends and social buzz higher.

```
0.25×T + 0.35×S + 0.05×G + 0.20×N + 0.05×D + 0.10×M
```

## How to Read the Index

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **0–25** | Cold — minimal attention |
| **26–50** | Warming — moderate interest |
| **51–75** | Hot — significant buzz |
| **76–100** | Viral — maximum attention |

A score of 72 for ChatGPT means it's generating significant attention across multiple channels. If that score jumped from 45 a week ago, something happened — and you probably want to know what.

## Why This Matters

For **traders**: Virality often precedes price action in prediction markets. When a model's AVI score spikes, it can signal an upcoming shift in market sentiment.

For **content creators**: Publishing content about a model when its AVI score is rising means you're riding the wave, not chasing it.

For **developers**: Tracking developer adoption (npm/PyPI downloads) alongside social buzz helps identify which AI platforms are gaining real traction vs. just hype.

## What's Next

We're building more features every week:

- **Trading signals** that fire when the index diverges from market prices
- **Weekly reports** with detailed analysis of movers and trends
- **API access** for building your own tools on top of AVI data
- **Email digest** with weekly highlights delivered to your inbox
